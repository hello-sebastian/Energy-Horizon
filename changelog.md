# Changelog

All notable changes to **Energy Horizon Card** (Home Assistant Lovelace / HACS) are documented in this file.



## [0.4.0-beta]

### Added
- **Time Windows Engine**: advanced data engine enable new way that data can handle to dispaly: use `time_window` in YAML to customize (preset merge, validation, LTS constraints).
– **New `Month Over Month` comparison preset**. 
- **Luxon** dependency for resolving anchored time ranges and window calculations.
- **Inteligent Aggregation & X-axis**: optional card-level `x_axis_format` (Luxon subset, validated at config time); automatic `hour`/`day`/`week`/`month` selection from merged `duration` when `aggregation` is omitted (~20–100 slot target).
- **Inteligent X-axis labeling**: adaptive Intl-based X labels (HA time zone; first tick is always a boundary); label locale cascade (`language` → HA → `en`); horizontal X labels with overlap hiding.
- **Tooltip header**: aggregation-aligned default formatting (no redundant year in comparisons; hour + multi-day window gets date disambiguation); optional card-level `tooltip_format` (Luxon subset, same validation as `x_axis_format`).

### Changed
- **Clarified `comparison_preset`** semantics in docs (`year_over_year`, `month_over_year`, `month_over_month`, including “month over month” meaning two consecutive full calendar months).
- **Forecast default behavior** and configuration (`show_forecast`, alias `forecast`).

### Fixed
- **ECharts renderer refactors** (series layering and legend ordering).
–  **5000** max timeline slots per series with localized error and optional `debug` console details.
